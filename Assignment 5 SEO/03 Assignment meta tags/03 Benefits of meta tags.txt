Q.3 What are the Benefits of using meta tags?
Ans. Using meta tags in HTML documents provides several benefits for web developers, search engines, and users. Some of the key benefits include


* SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Meta tags,such as the "description" and "keywords" tags, can help improve a webpage's visibility on search engine result pages (SERPs). A well-crafted meta description can attract users to click on the link, while the keywords tag, although less impactful than in the past, can still provide search engines with relevant information about the page's content.


* Social Media Sharing: Meta tags like the Open Graph Protocol tags allow developers to control how web pages are displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. They define the title, description, and image that appear in social media posts, making shared links more attractive and informative.


* Character Encoding and Language: The meta tag specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) ensures that the browser interprets the text correctly, especially when dealing with special characters or multilingual content.


* Viewport Control: The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design. It allows developers to set the initial scale and width of the viewport, making sure the webpage adapts well to different screen sizes and resolutions.


* HTTP-Equiv Tags: Meta tags with http-equiv attribute (e.g., <meta http-equiv= “refresh”>) enable specific HTTP header functionalities, like refreshing or redirecting the page after a certain time. While overusing them can be detrimental, there are valid use cases for handling page  behavior.


* Web Accessibility: Certain meta tags can improve web accessibility by providing additional information to assistive technologies, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.
