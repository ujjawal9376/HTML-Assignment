        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
            example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
            and data tables.
        </dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is
            displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML or JavaScript.
            Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements.</dd>

        <dt>CSS Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>A CSS framework is a prepped and ready-to-use CSS library (Cascading Style Sheets). The stylesheets
            collection makes the job of a UI developer easier. Rather than starting every project from scratch, a CSS
            framework gives them tools to quickly create a user interface that they repeat and tweak during a project.
        </dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web
            pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up
            menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.</dd>
        <dt>DSA</dt>
        <dd>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a public-key cryptosystem and Federal Information Processing
            Standard for digital signatures, based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and the
            discrete logarithm problem.</dd>

        <dt>React.Js</dt>
        <dd>
            React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook which, among other things, was used to build
            Instagram.com. It aims to allow developers to create fast user interfaces for websites and applications
            alike easily.</dd>

        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of
            in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating
            system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.</dd>

        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd> Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile
            applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built
            on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.</dd>
